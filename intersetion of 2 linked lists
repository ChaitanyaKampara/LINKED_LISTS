Find the intersection point between 2 linked lists

1st approach : find the respective lengths of LL's (5,7) 
               difference = 2 (now traverse 5 LL with slow pointer as 1
                               then traverse 7 LL's with fast pointer as 2)
The moment they collide , that is the intersection node b/w LL's .(if donot collide return null) -O(2M)


Optimal approach : create 2 dummey vars they travel the LL's in this the magic is traverse them untill null 
                   for d1 in LL1(5) , d2 in LL2(7) : once d1 entered NULL add d1 to starting point of LL2 and viceversa
                   Now they both will be in same lane and the colliding point is intersection point -O(2M)
